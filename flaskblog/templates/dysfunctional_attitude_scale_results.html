<p>
    I. Approval. The first five attitudes on the DAS test probe your tendency to measure your self-esteem based on
    how
    people react to you and what they think of you. A positive score between zero and ten indicates you are
    independent,
    with a healthy sense of your own worth even when confronted with criticism and disapproval. A negative score
    between
    zero and minus ten indicates you are excessively dependent because you evaluate yourself through other people's
    eyes. If someone insults you or puts you down, you automatically tend to look down on yourself. Since your
    emotional
    well-being is exquisitely sensitive to what you imagine people think of you, you can be easily manipulated, and
    you
    are vulnerable to anxiety and depression when others criticize you or are angry with you.
</p>
<p>
    II. Love. The second
    five
    attitudes on the test assess your tendency to base your worth on whether or not you are loved. A positive score
    indicates you see love as desirable, but you have a wide range of other interests you also find gratifying and
    fulfilling. Hence, love is not a requirement for your happiness or self-esteem. People are likely to find you
    attractive because you radiate a healthy sense of self-love and are interested in many aspects of living. A
    negative
    score indicates you are a "love junkie." You see love as a "need" without which you cannot survive, much less be
    happy. The closer your score is to minus ten, the more dependent on love you are. You tend to adopt inferior,
    put-down roles in relationships with people you care about for fear of alienating them. The result of this, more
    often than not, is that they lose respect for you and consider you a burden because of your attitude that
    without
    their love you would collapse. As you sense that people drift away from you, you become gripped by a painful,
    terrifying withdrawal syndrome. You realize you may not be able to "shoot up" with your daily dose of affection
    and
    attention. You then become consumed by the driving compulsion to "get love." Like most junkies, you may even
    resort
    to coercive, manipulative behavior to get your "stuff." Ironically, your needy, greedy love addiction drives
    many
    people away, thus intensifying your loneliness.
</p>
<p> III. Achievement Your score on attitudes 11 through 15 will help
    you
    measure a different type of addiction. A negative score indicates you are a workaholic. You have a constricted
    sense
    of your own humanity, and you see yourself as a commodity in the marketplace. The more negative your score, the
    more
    your sense of self-worth and your capacity for joy are dependent on your productivity. If you go on vacation, if
    your business slumps, if you retire or become ill and inactive, you will be in danger of an emotional crash.
    Economic and emotional depressions will seem identical to you. A positive score, in contrast, indicates that you
    enjoy creativity and productivity, but do not see them as an exclusive or necessary road to self-esteem and
    satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
    IV. Perfectionism. Items 16 through 20 measure your tendency to perfectionism. A negative score
    indicates you are hooked on searching for the Holy Grail. You demand perfection in yourself—mistakes are taboo,
    failure is worse than death, and even negative emotions are a disaster. You're supposed to look, feel, think,
    and
    behave superbly at all times. You sense that being less than spectacular means burning in the flames of hell.
    Although you drive yourself at an intense pace, your satisfactions are meager. Once you do achieve a goal,
    another
    more distant goal instantly replaces it, so you never experience the reward of getting to the top of the
    mountain.
    Eventually you begin to wonder why the promised payoff from all your effort never seems to materialize. Your
    life
    becomes a joyless, tedious treadmill. You are living with unrealistic, impossible personal standards, and you
    need
    to reevaluate them. Your problem does not lie in your performance, but in the yardstick you use to measure it.
    If
    you bring your expectations in line with reality, you will be regularly pleased and rewarded instead of
    frustrated.
    A positive score suggests you have the capacity to set meaningful, flexible, appropriate standards. You get
    great
    satisfaction from processes and experiences, and you are not exclusively fixated on outcomes. You don't have to
    be
    outstanding at everything, and you don't always have to "try your best." You don't fear mistakes, but you see
    them
    as golden opportunities to learn and to endorse your humanity. Paradoxically, you are likely to be much more
    productive than your perfectionistic associates because you do not become compulsively preoccupied with detail
    and
    correctness. Your life is like a flowing river or a geyser compared with your rigid perfectionistic friends who
    appear more like icy glaciers.
</p>
<p>
    V. Entitlement. Attitudes 21 through 25 measure your sense of "entitlement." A
    negative score indicates that you feel "entitled" to things—success, love, happiness, etc. You expect and demand
    that your wants be met by other people and by the universe at large because of your inherent goodness or hard
    work.
    When this does not happen—as is often the case—you are locked into one of two reactions. Either you feel
    depressed
    and inadequate or you become irate. Thus, you consume enormous amounts of energy being frustrated, sad, and mad.
    Much of the time you see life as a sour, rotten experience. You complain loudly and often, but you do little to
    solve problems. After all, you're entitled to have them solved, so why should you have to put out any effort? As
    a
    result of your bitter, demanding attitudes, you invariably get far less of what you want from life. A positive
    score
    suggests you don't feel automatically entitled to things, so you negotiate for what you want and often get it.
    Because of your awareness that other people are unique and different, you realize there is no inherent reason
    why
    things should always go your way. You experience a negative outcome as a disappointment but not a tragedy
    because
    you are a percentage player, and you don't expect perfect reciprocity or "justice" at all times. You are patient
    and
    persistent, and you have a high frustration tolerance. As a result, you often end up ahead of the pack.
</p>
<p>
    VI. Omnipotence. Attitudes 26 through 30 measure your tendency to see yourself as the center of your personal
    universe
    and to hold yourself responsible for much of what goes on around you. A negative score indicates you often make
    the
    personalization error discussed in Chapters 3 and 6. You blame yourself inappropriately for the negative actions
    and
    attitudes of others who are not really under your control. Consequently, you are plagued by guilt and
    self-condemnation. Paradoxically, the attitude that you should be omnipotent and all-powerful cripples you and
    leaves you anxious and ineffectual. A positive score, in contrast, indicates you know the joy that comes from
    accepting that you are not the center of the universe. Since you are not in control of other adults, you are not
    ultimately responsible for them but only for yourself. This attitude does not isolate you from others. Quite the
    opposite is true. You relate to people effectively as a friendly collaborator, and you are not threatened when
    they
    disagree with your ideas or fail to follow your advice. Because your attitude gives people a sense of freedom
    and
    dignity, you paradoxically become a human magnet. Others often want to be close to you because you have
    relinquished
    any attempt to control them. People frequently listen to and respect your ideas because you do not polarize them
    with an angry insistence they must agree with you. As you give up your drive for power, people repay you by
    making
    you a person of influence. Your relationships with your children and friends and associates are characterized by
    mutuality instead of dependency. Because you don't try to dominate people, they admire, love, and respect you.
</p>
<p>
    VII.
    Autonomy. Items 31 through 35 measure your autonomy. This refers to your ability to find happiness within
    yourself.
    A positive score indicates that all your moods are ultimately the children of your thoughts and attitudes. You
    assume responsibility for your feelings because you recognize they are ultimately created by you. This sounds as
    if
    you might be lonely and isolated because you realize that all meaning and feelings are created only in your
    head.
    Paradoxically, however, this vision of autonomy frees you from the petty confines of your mind and delivers the
    world to you with a full measure of all the satisfaction, mystery, and excitement that it can offer. A negative
    score suggests you are still trapped in the belief that your potential for joy and self-esteem comes from the
    outside. This puts you at a great disadvantage because everything outside is ultimately beyond your control.
    Your
    moods end up the victim of external factors. Do you want this? If not, you can eventually free yourself from
    this
    attitude as surely as a snake sheds its skin, but you will have to work at it with the various methods outlined
    in
    this book. When it's finally your turn to experience the transformation to autonomy and personal responsibility,
    you
    will be amazed—or awestruck—or pleased—or delightfully overwhelmed. It's well worth a major personal commitment.

<p>
    In
    the following chapters a number of these attitudes and value systems will be examined in detail. As you study
    each
    one, ask yourself: (1) Is it to my advantage to maintain this particular belief? (2) Is this belief really true
    and
    valid? (3) What specific steps can I take that will allow me to rid myself of attitudes that are self-defeating
    and
    unrealistic, and substitute others that are more objective and more self-enhancing?
