    <h3>Your scores were elevated on questions 23, 24 and 25, these questions asked you about your suicidal feelings,
        urges and plans. We strongly suggest you obtain professional help immediately. </h3>

{% if level_of_depression == "no depression" %}
<div>
    Your score is between 0 and 5, you are probably feeling good already. This is in the range of normal, and most
    people with scores this low feel pretty happily contented.
</div>
<br>

{% elif level_of_depression == "normal but unhappy" %}
<div>
    Your score was between 6 and 10, it is still in the range of normal, but you are probably feeling a bit on the
    "lumpy" side. There's room for improvement, a little mental "tuneup," if you will. The cognitive therapy techniques
    in this book can often be remarkably helpful in these instances. Problems in daily living bug all of us, and a
    change of perspective can often make a big difference in how you feel.

</div>
<br>

{% elif level_of_depression == "mild depression" %}
<div>Your score was between 11 and 25, your depression, at least at this time, is mild and should not be a cause for
    alarm. You will definitely want to correct this problem, and you may be able to make substantial progress on your
    own. Systematic self-help efforts along the lines proposed in this book, combined with frank communication on a
    number of occasions with a trusted friend, may help a great deal. But if your score remains in this range for more
    than a few weeks, you should consider professional treatment. The help of a therapist or an antidepressant
    medication may considerably speed your recovery.

    Some of the thorniest depressions I have treated were actually individuals whose scores were in the mild range.
    Often these individuals had been mildly depressed for years, sometimes for most of their entire life. A mild chronic
    depression that goes on and on is now called "dysthymic disorder." Although that is a big, fancy-sounding term, it
    has a simple meaning. All it means is, "this person is awfully gloomy and negative most of the time." You probably
    know someone who is like that, and you may have fallen into spells of pessimism yourself. Fortunately, the same
    methods in this book that have proven so helpful for severe depressions can also be very helpful for these mild,
    chronic depressions.
</div>
<br>

{% elif level_of_depression == "moderate depression" %}
<div>You scored between 26 and 50 on the BDC, it means you are moderately depressed. But don't be fooled by the term,
    "moderate." A score in this range can indicate pretty intense suffering. Most of us can feel quite upset for brief
    periods, but we usually snap out of it. If your score remains in this range for more than two weeks, you should
    definitely seek professional treatment.
</div>
<br>

{% elif level_of_depression == "severe depression" or level_of_depression == "extreme depression" %}
<div> Your score was above 50, it indicates your depression is severe or even extreme. This degree of suffering can
    be almost unbearable, especially when the score is increased above 75. Your moods are apt to be intensely
    uncomfortable and possibly dangerous because the feelings of despair and hopelessness may even trigger suicidal
    impulses. Fortunately, the prognosis for successful treatment is excellent. In fact, sometimes the most severe
    depressions respond the most rapidly. But it is not wise to try to treat a severe depression on your own. A
    professional consultation is a must. Seek out a trusted and competent counselor. Even if you receive psychotherapy
    or antidepressant medications, I am convinced you can still benefit greatly by applying what I teach you. My
    research studies have indicated that the spirit of self-help greatly speeds up recovery, even when patients receive
    professional treatment.

{% if health_concern == True %}
<div>
    Have you experienced any unexplained aches, pains, fever, weight loss, or other possible symptoms of medical
    illness? We noticed your score for question 22, relating to health concerns was raised.
    If so, it would be worthwhile to have a medical consultation, which would include a history, a complete
    physical examination, and laboratory tests. Your doctor will probably give you a clean bill of health. This will
    suggest that your uncomfortable physical symptoms are related to your emotional state. Depression can mimic a great
    number of medical disorders because your mood swings often create a wide variety of puzzling physical symptoms.
    These include, to name just a few, constipation, diarrhea, pain, insomnia or the tendency to sleep too much,
    fatigue, loss of sexual interest, light-headedness, trembling, and numbness. As your depression improves, these
    symptoms will in all likelihood vanish. However, keep in mind that many treatable illnesses may initially masquerade
    as depression, and a medical examination could reveal an early (and lifesaving) diagnosis of a reversible organic
    disorder.
