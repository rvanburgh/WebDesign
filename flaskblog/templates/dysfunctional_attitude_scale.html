<h2>Dysfunctional Attitude Test</h2>
<p>
    Because of the crucial importance of eliciting the silent assumptions that give rise to your mood swings, a method
    called the "Dysfunctional Attitude Scale" (DAS) has been developed by Dr. Arlene
    Weissman. She has compiled a list of one hundred self-defeating attitudes that commonly occur
    in individuals predisposed to emotional disorders. Her research has indicated that while negative automatic thoughts
    are reduced dramatically between episodes of depression, a self-defeating belief system remains more or less
    constant during episodes of depression and remission. Dr. Weissman's studies confirm the concept that your silent
    assumptions represent a predisposition to emotional turbulence that you carry with you at all times.

    Instructions: Put a check (âœ”) on the answer that represents your estimate of how you think most of the time. Because
    we are all different, there is no "right" or "wrong" answer to any statement. To decide whether a given attitude is
    typical of your own philosophy, recall how you look at things most of the time.
